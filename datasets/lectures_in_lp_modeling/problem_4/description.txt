PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- Consider the problem of operating a warehouse, by buying and selling the stock of a certain commodity, in order to maximize profit over a certain length of time, say several periods.
- The warehouse has a fixed capacity \var{capacity}, and there is a cost \var{holding_cost} per unit for holding stock for one period.
- The selling price, \var{price_{n}}$, of the commodity is known to fluctuate over a number of time periods. 
- In any period \var{n} the price holding for purchase is \var{cost_{n}}.
- The warehouse is originally empty and is required to be empty at the end of the last period.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"capacity": capacity,
	"holding_cost": holding_cost,
	"price", [price_{n} for n in 1,...,N],
	"cost": [cost_{n} for n in 1,...,N]
}


OBJECTIVE: Determine the amount of buying and selling in each period to maximize the profit over the months

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{buyquantity} represents the amount of buying in each period
- \var{sellquantity} represents the amount of selling in each period
- \var{stock} represents the stock in each period, excluding the intial stock

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"buyquantity": [buyquantity_{n} for n in 1,...,N],
	"sellquantity": [sellquantity_{n} for n in 1,...,N],
	"stock": [stock_{n} for n in 1,...,N]
}
