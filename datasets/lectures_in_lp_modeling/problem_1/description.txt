PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- We suppose that some products can be produced, each of them passing through several stages.
- Necessary time to produce 1 unit of product \var{k} is \var{produce_time_{k, s}} hours for stage \var{s}.
- Availability in working hours is \var{time_{s}} for stage \var{s}. 
- The unitary profits for product \var{k} is \var{profit_{k}}.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"produce_time": [[produce_time_{k, s} for s in 1,...,S] for k in 1,...,K],
	"available_time": [time_{s} for s in 1,...,S],
	"profit": [profit_{k} for k in 1,...,K]
}


OBJECTIVE: Determine the quantities to be produced such that all the production constraints are satisfied and the profit is maximized.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{quantity} represents the production quantity for each product

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"quantity": [quantity_{k} for k in 1,...,K]
}
