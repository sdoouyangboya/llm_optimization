PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- We assume that there are available at the market different foods and that the food \var{k} sells at a price \var{price_{k}} per unit. 
- In addition there are several basic nutritional ingredients and, to achieve a balanced diet, each individual must receive at least \var{demand_{m}} units of nutrient \var{m} per day. 
- Finally, we assume that each unit of food \var{k} contains \var{nutri_{k, m}} units of nutrition \var{m}

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"price": [price_{k} for k in 1,...,K],
	"demand": [demand_{m} for m in 1,...,M],
	"nutrition": [[nutri_{k, m} for m in 1,...,M] for k in 1,...,K]
}


OBJECTIVE: We want to minimize the total prices of the foods to purchase.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{quantity} represents the quantity of each food to purchase

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"quantity": [quantity_{k} for k in 1,...,K]
}
