PROBLEM TYPE: MILP

PROBLEM INFO: 
- A company produces \var{N} kinds of products. 
- A product of the \var{i}-th type requires \var{assemblyHour_i} hours of assembly labor, \var{testingHour_i} hours of testing, and \var{materialCost_i} worth of raw materials (in $).
- Given the current personnel of the company, there can be at most \var{maxAssembly} hours of assembly labor and \var{maxTesting} hours of testing, each day.
- Product of the \var{i}-th type has a price of \var{price_i} dollars.
- The company can schedule up tp \var{maxOvertimeAssembly} hours of overtime assembly labor can be schedÂ­uled, at a cost of \var{overtimeAssemblyCost} per hour.
- Suppose that the raw material supplier provides a \var{materialDiscount}% discount if the daily bill is above \var{discountThreshold} dollars (\var{materialDiscount} is a number between 0 and 100).

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "assemblyHour": [assemblyHour_i for i in 1, ..., N]
    "testingHour": [testingHour_i for i in 1, ..., N],
    "materialCost": [materialCost_i for i in 1, ..., N],
    "maxAssembly": maxAssembly
    "maxTesting": maxTesting,
    "price": [price_i for i in 1, ..., N],
    "maxOvertimeAssembly": maxOvertimeAssembly,
    "overtimeAssemblyCost": overtimeAssemblyCost,
    "materialDiscount": materialDiscount,
    "discountThreshold": discountThreshold
}

OBJECTIVE: We want to maximize the daily profit of the company, which is the total revenue minus the total cost.

OUTPUT INFO: 

- \var{dailyProfit} shows the daily profit of the company 
- \var{unitsProduced_i} shows the number of units of the \var{i}-th product produced
- \var{overtimeAssembly} shows the number of hours of overtime assembly labor scheduled
- \var{materialBought} shows the amount of raw materials bought

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "dailyProfit": dailyProfit,
    "unitsProduced": [unitsProduced_i for i in 1, ..., N],
    "overtimeAssembly": overtimeAssembly,
    "materialBought": materialBought
