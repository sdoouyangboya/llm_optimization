PROBLEM TYPE: MILP

PROBLEM INFO: 
- A hospital wants to make a weekly night shift (12pm-8am) schedule for its nurses. 
- The demand for nurses for the night shift on day \var{j} = 1,...,7 is an integer \var{d_j}. 
- Every nurse works \var{period} days in a row on the night shift, followed by (7 - \var{period}) days off.


INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "period": period,
    "demand": [d_j for j in 1, ...,7]
}

OBJECTIVE: The goal is to find the minimal number of nurses the hospital needs to hire. 

OUTPUT INFO: 

- for each day \var{j} = 1,...,7, \var{start_j} which shows the number of nurses that start their period on day \var{j}.
- the total number of nurses hired.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "start": [start_j for j in 1, ...,7],
    "total": total
}
