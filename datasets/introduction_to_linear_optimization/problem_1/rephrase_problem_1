In this scenario, we are dealing with a resource allocation problem. Here's the context and the problem rephrased in natural language:

Context:

We have a certain stock of resources available, each with its own quantity. The resources are listed as follows with their respective quantities:

Resource 1: 10 units
Resource 2: 20 units
Resource 3: 15 units
Resource 4: 35 units
Resource 5: 25 units
There are different projects (or requirements) that need these resources. Each project requires a specific amount of each resource. The requirements for each project are:

Project 1 requires:

3 units of Resource 1
2 units of Resource 2
Project 2 requires:

5 units of Resource 2
2 units of Resource 3
1 unit of Resource 4
Project 3 requires:

1 unit of Resource 1
5 units of Resource 4
3 units of Resource 5
Project 4 requires:

3 units of Resource 2
1 unit of Resource 3
1 unit of Resource 4
5 units of Resource 5
Additionally, each project is associated with a price, indicating the cost or investment needed for the project. The prices are as follows:

Price for Project 1: $7
Price for Project 2: $10
Price for Project 3: $5
Price for Project 4: $9
Objective:

The task is to allocate the available resources to these projects in a way that meets the requirements of each project. The details of resource allocation, along with the prices for each project, should be organized and saved in a structured format (JSON file named "output.json"). The JSON file should be formatted with an indentation of 4 spaces.
