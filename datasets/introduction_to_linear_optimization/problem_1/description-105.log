You are an operations analyst and expert mathematical modeller AI bot.
Your task is to formulate and solve the given optimization problem as a LP. Please read the problem information, input format, and objective carefully and provide a detailed mathematical formulation.

### PROBLEM INFORMATION:


- A firm produces \var{M} different goods using \var{N} different raw materials.
- The firm has \var{available_{i}} of raw material \var{i} available.
- Good \var{j} requires \var{req_{i,j}} units of material \var{i} per unit produced.
- Good \var{j} results in a revenue of \var{price_j} per unit produced.



### INPUT FORMAT:


{
    "available": [available_{i} for i in 1, ..., N]
    "requirements": [[req_{i,j} for i in 1, ..., N] for j in 1, ..., M],
    "prices": [price_{j} for j in 1, ..., M]
}


- Variables enclosed in [ ] represent lists of values.
- Names enclosed in quotes (") represent keys and are identical to those in the data file.
- All other items are variables as described in the problem description and should be replaced with their actual values from the data file.

### OBJECTIVE: 

How much of each good should the firm produce in order to maximize its total revenue?

### OUTPUT INFORMATION:


- the amount of each good produced \var{amount_{j}}.


### OUTPUT FORMAT:


{
    "amount": [amount_{j} for j in 1, ..., M]
}


### INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Clearly define the decision variables.
2. Formulate the objective function precisely.
3. List all the constraints, ensuring they are complete and non-redundant.
4. Ensure the formulation is coherent, logical, and solvable.
5. Provide any necessary explanations or clarifications for your formulation.


Please respond with a well-structured mathematical formulation of the given optimization problem, adhering to the instructions and format provided above.

### DECISION VARIABLES:

Let's denote:

- \(x_j\): The amount of good \(j\) produced, for \(j = 1, ..., M\). These are our decision variables.

### OBJECTIVE FUNCTION:

The objective of the firm is to maximize its total revenue. The revenue from each good is the amount produced times its price. Therefore, the objective function is:

Maximize \(Z = \sum_{j=1}^{M} price_j * x_j\)

### CONSTRAINTS:

The constraints of the problem come from the limited availability of raw materials. The total amount of each raw material used cannot exceed its availability. The amount of material \(i\) used to produce good \(j\) is \(req_{i,j} * x_j\), and summing over all goods gives the total amount used. Therefore, the constraints are:

\(\sum_{j=1}^{M} req_{i,j} * x_j \leq available_i\) for \(i = 1, ..., N\)

Also, the amount of each good produced must be non-negative:

\(x_j \geq 0\) for \(j = 1, ..., M\)

### MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION:

Maximize \(Z = \sum_{j=1}^{M} price_j * x_j\)

Subject to:

\(\sum_{j=1}^{M} req_{i,j} * x_j \leq available_i\) for \(i = 1, ..., N\)

\(x_j \geq 0\) for \(j = 1, ..., M\)

This is a linear programming problem as the objective function and all constraints are linear. The decision variables represent quantities of goods to be produced, which are continuous and can take any non-negative values, making this a continuous optimization problem.

Now, please generate a Python code using gurobi to solve the formulated optimization problem. The code will read the problem data from a file named "data.json" and should save the output in a file named "output.json".


OUTPUT INFO: 

- the amount of each good produced \var{amount_{j}}.


your code should save the output as a file named "output.json" with indents of 4 spaces in this format:


{
    "amount": [amount_{j} for j in 1, ..., M]
}

when writing the code, remember that
- Write your code in PEP 8 Python format
- if problem data is presented in percentage (%), do not forget to preprocess it
- Use 'model = gp.Model()' to define the Gurobi model object
- all keys that you read from the data file are strings and not integers
- try to keep the code for adding different constraints separate to avoid confusion
- ONLY generate the code, and don't generate anything else! I've already installed the necessary libraries.
- Wrap the code using markdown ```
- Write code in Python PEP 8 style
- Use 'model' as the name of the gurobi model object



### INSTRUCTIONS:
1. **Read Data**: Read all necessary data from "data.json". Remember, all keys in the data file are strings.
2. **Solver Instructions**: 
- Write your code in PEP 8 Python format
- if problem data is presented in percentage (%), do not forget to preprocess it
- Use 'model = gp.Model()' to define the Gurobi model object
3. **Code Structure**: Structure your code clearly, keeping the code for adding different constraints separate to maintain readability and avoid confusion.
4. **Output File**: Save the results in "output.json" using the specified format.
5. **Libraries**: Do not include installation of libraries; assume all necessary libraries are already installed.
6. **Markdown**: Wrap the generated code using markdown triple backticks (```) to maintain format.

Take a deep breath and work on this problem step by step.

Here is the Python code using Gurobi to solve the formulated optimization problem:

```python
import json
from gurobipy import Model, GRB

# Step 1: Read Data
with open('data.json', 'r') as f:
    data = json.load(f)

available = data['available']
requirements = data['requirements']
prices = data['prices']

N = len(available)
M = len(prices)

# Step 2: Create a new model
model = Model()

# Step 3: Create variables
x = model.addVars(M, lb=0, vtype=GRB.CONTINUOUS, name="x")

# Step 4: Set objective
model.setObjective(sum(prices[j]*x[j] for j in range(M)), GRB.MAXIMIZE)

# Step 5: Add constraints
for i in range(N):
    model.addConstr(sum(requirements[j][i]*x[j] for j in range(M)) <= available[i])

# Step 6: Solve the model
model.optimize()

# Step 7: Write the solution to a file
solution = [x[j].x for j in range(M)]
output = {"amount": solution}

with open('output.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(output, f, indent=4)
```

This Python code reads the problem data from "data.json", builds and solves the optimization model using Gurobi, and writes the solution to "output.json". The solution is the amount of each good to be produced to maximize the total revenue, given the availability of raw materials and the requirements of each good.
