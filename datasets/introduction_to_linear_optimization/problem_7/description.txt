PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Suppose that \var{Z} is a random variable taking values 0, 1, ..., \var{K}, with probabilities var{p_0}, \var{p_1}, ..., \var{p_K}, respectively.
- We are given the values of the first two moments:

E[\var{Z}] = \sum_{k=0}^{\var{K}} k \var{p_k} 
E[\var{Z}^2] = \sum_{k=0}^{\var{K}} k^2 \var{p_k} of \var{Z} 

- We would like to obtain upper and lower bounds on the value of the fourth moment 

E[\var{Z}_4] = \sum_{k=0}^{K} k^4 \var{p_k} of \var{Z}

Show how linear programming can be used to approach this problem. 				

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "K": K,
    "p": [p_i for i in 0, ..., K]
    "E[Z]": E[Z],
    "E[Z^2]": E[Z^2],
}

OBJECTIVE: Use linear programming to find lower and upper bounds on E[Z^4].

OUTPUT INFO:

- The lower and upper bounds on E[Z^4] should be stored in the variables lower_bound and upper_bound, respectively.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "lower_bound": lower_bound,
    "upper_bound": upper_bound,
}
