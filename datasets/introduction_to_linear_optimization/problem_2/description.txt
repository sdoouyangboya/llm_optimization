PROBLEM TYPE: MIP

PROBLEM INFO:

- Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) has introduced new families of \var{N} computer systems with different memory, disk storage, and expansion capabilities.
- Each system \var{i} is either a general-purpose (GP) system or a workstation (WS) system.
- Each system \var{i} can have an integer number of disk drives, and on average \var{disk_i} units of disk drive per system are requested by customers for system \var{i}.
- System \var{i} uses \var{mem_i} units of 256K memory boards per system on average.
- System \var{i} has a price of \var{price_i} dollars.
- The in-house supplier of CPUs for DEC could provide at most \var{max_cpu} units, due to debugging problems.
- The supply of disk drives is uncertain and is estimated by the manufacturer to be in the range of \var{min_disk} to \var{max_disk} units.
- the supply of 256K memory boards is also limited in the range of \var{min_mem} to \var{max_mem} units.
- Maximum demand for system \var{i} in the next quarter is estimated to be \var{demand_i} units.
- Maximum demand for the whole GP family in the next quarter is estimated to be \var{demand_GP} units.
- Maximum demand for the whole WS family in the next quarter is estimated to be \var{demand_WS} units.
- Included in the projections, there are \var{preorder_i} orders for system \var{i} that have already been received and have to be fulfilled in the next quarter.
- To address the shortage of 256K memory boards, DEC has access to \var{alt_mem} units of an alternative memory board that can only be used in certain systems.
- you can assume the number of systems produced is a floating point number to make the problem easier to solve.

OBJECTIVE: How many of which system should DEC produce and using what memories and disks to maximize the profit for the next quarter?


OUTPUT INFO:
- A json file with "system_output" and "profit" as keys.
- "system_output" contains a list of different types of systems produced 
- for each system, \var{num_produced} is the number of systems produced, \var{total_256K_boards_used} is the number of 256K memory boards used, \var{total_alt_boards_used} is the number of alternative memory boards used, and \var{total_disk_drives_used} is the number of disk drives used in that system.
- "profit" is the total profit for the next quarter.
