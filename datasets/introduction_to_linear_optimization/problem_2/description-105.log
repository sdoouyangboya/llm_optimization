You are an operations analyst and expert mathematical modeller AI bot.
Your task is to formulate and solve the given optimization problem as a MIP. Please read the problem information, input format, and objective carefully and provide a detailed mathematical formulation.

### PROBLEM INFORMATION:


- Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) has introduced new families of \var{N} computer systems with different memory, disk storage, and expansion capabilities.
- Each system \var{i} is either a general-purpose (GP) system or a workstation (WS) system.
- Each system \var{i} can have an integer number of disk drives, and on average \var{disk_i} units of disk drive per system are requested by customers for system \var{i}.
- System \var{i} uses \var{mem_i} units of 256K memory boards per system on average.
- System \var{i} has a price of \var{price_i} dollars.
- The in-house supplier of CPUs for DEC could provide at most \var{max_cpu} units, due to debugging problems.
- The supply of disk drives is uncertain and is estimated by the manufacturer to be in the range of \var{min_disk} to \var{max_disk} units.
- the supply of 256K memory boards is also limited in the range of \var{min_mem} to \var{max_mem} units.
- Maximum demand for system \var{i} in the next quarter is estimated to be \var{demand_i} units.
- Maximum demand for the whole GP family in the next quarter is estimated to be \var{demand_GP} units.
- Maximum demand for the whole WS family in the next quarter is estimated to be \var{demand_WS} units.
- Included in the projections, there are \var{preorder_i} orders for system \var{i} that have already been received and have to be fulfilled in the next quarter.
- To address the shortage of 256K memory boards, DEC has access to \var{alt_mem} units of an alternative memory board that can only be used in certain systems.
- you can assume the number of systems produced is a floating point number to make the problem easier to solve.


### INPUT FORMAT:

### DECISION VARIABLES:

Let's denote:

- \(x_i\): number of system \(i\) produced (continuous variable)
- \(mem_i\): number of 256K memory boards used in system \(i\) (continuous variable)
- \(alt_i\): number of alternative memory boards used in system \(i\) (continuous variable)
- \(disk_i\): number of disk drives used in system \(i\) (continuous variable)

for \(i = 1, ..., N\).

### OBJECTIVE FUNCTION:

The objective is to maximize the total profit for the next quarter. This can be formulated as:

Maximize \(Z = \sum_{i=1}^{N} price_i * x_i\)

### CONSTRAINTS:

1. **Demand constraints**: The number of systems produced should not exceed the demand.
    - \(x_i \leq demand_i\) for \(i = 1, ..., N\)
    - \(\sum_{i: is\_workstation[i] = false} x_i \leq demand\_GP\)
    - \(\sum_{i: is\_workstation[i] = true} x_i \leq demand\_WS\)

2. **Preorder constraints**: The number of systems produced should be at least the number of preorders.
    - \(x_i \geq preorder_i\) for \(i = 1, ..., N\)

3. **CPU supply constraint**: The total number of systems produced should not exceed the CPU supply.
    - \(\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i \leq max\_cpu\)

4. **Disk drive supply constraints**: The total number of disk drives used should be within the supply range.
    - \(\sum_{i=1}^{N} disk_i \geq min\_disk\)
    - \(\sum_{i=1}^{N} disk_i \leq max\_disk\)

5. **Memory board supply constraints**: The total number of 256K memory boards and alternative memory boards used should be within the supply range.
    - \(\sum_{i=1}^{N} mem_i \geq min\_mem\)
    - \(\sum_{i=1}^{N} mem_i \leq max\_mem\)
    - \(\sum_{i: alt\_compatible[i] = true} alt_i \leq alt\_mem\)

6. **System specification constraints**: The number of disk drives and memory boards used in each system should match the system's specifications.
    - \(disk_i = disk\_drives[i] * x_i\) for \(i = 1, ..., N\)
    - \(mem_i + alt_i = 256K\_boards[i] * x_i\) for \(i = 1, ..., N\)

7. **Non-negativity constraints**:
    - \(x_i, mem_i, alt_i, disk_i \geq 0\) for \(i = 1, ..., N\)

This formulation ensures that the number of systems produced, the number of disk drives used, and the number of memory boards used are optimized to maximize the total profit while satisfying all the constraints related to demand, preorders, supply, and system specifications.

Now, please generate a Python code using gurobi to solve the formulated optimization problem. The code will read the problem data from a file named "data.json" and should save the output in a file named "output.json".


OUTPUT INFO: 
- A json file with "system_output" and "profit" as keys.
- "system_output" contains a list of different types of systems produced 
- for each system, \var{num_produced} is the number of systems produced, \var{total_256K_boards_used} is the number of 256K memory boards used, \var{total_alt_boards_used} is the number of alternative memory boards used, and \var{total_disk_drives_used} is the number of disk drives used in that system.
- "profit" is the total profit for the next quarter.


your code should save the output as a file named "output.json" with indents of 4 spaces in this format:


{
    "system_output": [
        {
            "num_produced": x_i,
            "total_256K_boards_used": mem_used_i,
            "total_alt_boards_used": alt_used_i,
            "total_disk_drives_used": disk_used_i
        }
        for i in 1, ..., T
    ],
    "profit": profit
}

when writing the code, remember that
- Write your code in PEP 8 Python format
- if problem data is presented in percentage (%), do not forget to preprocess it
- Use 'model = gp.Model()' to define the Gurobi model object
- all keys that you read from the data file are strings and not integers
- try to keep the code for adding different constraints separate to avoid confusion
- ONLY generate the code, and don't generate anything else! I've already installed the necessary libraries.
- Wrap the code using markdown ```
- Write code in Python PEP 8 style
- Use 'model' as the name of the gurobi model object



### INSTRUCTIONS:
1. **Read Data**: Read all necessary data from "data.json". Remember, all keys in the data file are strings.
2. **Solver Instructions**: 
- Write your code in PEP 8 Python format
- if problem data is presented in percentage (%), do not forget to preprocess it
- Use 'model = gp.Model()' to define the Gurobi model object
3. **Code Structure**: Structure your code clearly, keeping the code for adding different constraints separate to maintain readability and avoid confusion.
4. **Output File**: Save the results in "output.json" using the specified format.
5. **Libraries**: Do not include installation of libraries; assume all necessary libraries are already installed.
6. **Markdown**: Wrap the generated code using markdown triple backticks (```) to maintain format.

Take a deep breath and work on this problem step by step.

The error message you're seeing is due to the fact that the Gurobi module is not installed in your Python environment. You need to install it before you can import it in your script. 

You can install Gurobi by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install gurobipy
```

If you have already installed Gurobi and still see this error, it's possible that you have multiple Python environments and Gurobi is installed in a different environment. In that case, make sure you're using the correct Python environment where Gurobi is installed.

Also, your current code is not considering the workstation and general-purpose system constraints. You need to add these constraints in your model.

The error message you're receiving indicates that the Python module 'gurobipy' is not found. This is not a syntax error in your code, but rather an issue with your Python environment. The 'gurobipy' module is not part of the standard Python library, so you need to install it before you can import it in your code.

You can install the 'gurobipy' module using pip, which is a package manager for Python. Open your terminal and type the following command:

```bash
pip install gurobipy
```

If you have multiple versions of Python installed on your machine and pip points to a different version than the one you're using, you might need to use pip3 instead:

```bash
pip3 install gurobipy
```

After running this command, 'gurobipy' should be available in your Python environment and the import statement in your code should work.

If you have already installed 'gurobipy' and still see this error, it's possible that you installed 'gurobipy' in a different Python environment than the one you're using to run your code. In that case, you need to make sure to install 'gurobipy' in the correct Python environment.

If you're using a Jupyter notebook, you can install 'gurobipy' directly in the notebook by running the following command in a code cell:

```python
!pip install gurobipy
```

Note: Gurobi is a commercial product and requires a license to use. You can obtain a free academic license if you are a student or faculty at a recognized degree-granting academic institution.

The error message you're seeing is because the `!pip install gurobipy` command is not valid Python syntax. It's a command that should be run in a Jupyter notebook or in the command line, not in a Python script. 

If you want to ensure that the `gurobipy` package is installed within your Python script, you can use `subprocess` module to run the command. However, it's generally better to handle package installations outside of the script, perhaps in a requirements.txt file or in the documentation for your script.

Here's how you might modify your script to run without syntax errors:

```python
import subprocess
import sys

def install(package):
    subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, "-m", "pip", "install", package])

# Install gurobipy if not already installed
try:
    import gurobipy
except ImportError:
    install('gurobipy')
    import gurobipy
```

The above code checks if `gurobipy` is installed, and if not, it installs it. However, remember that this approach is not generally recommended. It's better to let users handle package installations themselves.
