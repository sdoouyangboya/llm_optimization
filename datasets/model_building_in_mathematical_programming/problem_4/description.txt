PROBLEM TYPE: MILP
PROBLEM INFO:

- An engineering factory makes several products on the machines, and the number of machine \var{m} the factory has is \var{num_{m}}.
- Each product \var{k} yields \var{profit_{k}} to profit (defined as Â£/unit selling price minus cost of raw materials).
- The unit production times (hours) product \var{k} requires on machine \var{m} is \var{time_{k, m}}
- In the present month (January) and several subsequent months, certain machines will be down for maintenance.
- Each machine \var{m} has to be down for \var{down_{m}} months for maintenance.
- There are marketing limitations on each product in each month. 
- The limitation of product \var{k} in month \var{i} is \var{limit_{k, i}}.
- It is possible to store up to 100 of each product at a time at a cost of \var{store_price} per unit per month. 
- There are no stocks at present, but it is desired to have a stock of \var{keep_quantity} of each type of product at the end of subsequent months.
- The factory works a six days a week with two shifts of \var{n_workhours} hours each day. 
- No sequencing problems need to be considered.
- We can assume that a month has 24 days for convenience.


INPUT FORMAT:

    "n_workhours": n_workhours
}

OBJECTIVE: What maintaining, selling, storing and manufacturing policy should the company pursue in order to maximize profit?

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{sell} represents the amount of selling quantity of each product in each month
- \var{manufacture} represents the amount of manufactured products in each month
- \var{storage} represents the storage of each product in each month
- \var{maintain} represents the number of machines in each type that are under maintenance in each month

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "sell": [[sell_{k, i} for k in 1,...,K] for i in 1,...I],
    "manufacture": [[manufacture_{k, i} for k in 1,...,K] for i in 1,...I],
    "storage": [[storage_{k, i} for k in 1,...,K] for i in 1,...,I],
    "maintain": [[maintain_{m, k} for m in 1,...,M] for k in 1,...,K]
